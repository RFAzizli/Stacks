# Stacks

This repo contains two types of Stacks, ArrayStack and LinkedStack.

First of all, what is a Stack.

Stack - linear data structure used to store collection of Objects.

Stacks are based on Last-In-First-Out.

The main concept of Stacks is that, whenever you want to access an element from the Stack, you can only access the topmost. 
Same goes for adding elements, you can't add an element to the bottom, middle of the stack, only top.

Stack has 3 major methods: push, pop, peek.


# Push
push(Object item) - adds a new Object to the top of Stack

# Pop
pop() - removes the topmost Object from the Stack.

# Peek
peek() - return the topmost Object from the Stack.
